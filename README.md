## 2D-plot-of-the-solar-system

This python program reads data from the table in the word document and uses three
computational techniques, to detrmine certain parameters, out of which the most 
efficent one is used to plot/simulate the oribits of the planets around the sun. 
It is assumed that the orbits of all planets lie in the same plane,the major axes 
of all planets coincide, and the minor axes of all planets coincide, and each planet 
moves under the gravitational influence of the Sun only, i.e. interplanetary gravitational 
interactions are to be ignored.

The following are calculated for each planets.

a) distance (in km) and speed (in km/s) at the aphelion,
b) the length of the semimajor axis (in 10^6 km),
c) sidereal orbit period (in days),
d) orbit eccentricity,
e) mean orbital velocity (km/s),


Note that when plotting the planets, jupyter and beyond are in a separate plot because 
the oribt gets relatively larger than the inner plantes. 

The code will generate a output text file and takes a few minutes to execute.
